# Horiseon HTML and CSS demo

## DRY CSS &amp; Assessible Semantic HTML

This project demonstrates a working example of HTML/CSS with clean, refactored code and meaningful HTML5 tags. All "div" elements have been replaced with newer, specific tags. The CSS document also follows a meaningful flow sequence and includes professional commenting.
